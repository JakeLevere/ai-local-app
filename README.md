# AI Local App

This Electron-based application uses the OpenAI API for certain features. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key before running the app. Without it, OpenAI features will fail to initialize.

## Project Files

`index.html` is the main renderer page loaded by Electron. A previous version of the interface has been kept for reference in `index-legacy.html`.
